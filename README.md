# SlateCSV
An ExtJS user interface for importing CSV files into Slate

## Getting started with development
1. Install latest 5.x Sencha CMD
2. Clone this repository
3. `cd slate-csv/sencha-workspace/packages`
4. `git clone https://github.com/SlateFoundation/slate-theme.git`
5. `git clone https://github.com/JarvusInnovations/jarvus-apikit`
7. `git clone https://github.com/JarvusInnovations/emergence-apikit.git`
8. `git clone https://github.com/SlateFoundation/slate-core-data.git`
9. `cd ../SlateCSV`
10. `sencha app build`

Then run a web server from the main `slate-csv` directory or higher in your file tree and navigate to the
`sencha-workspace/SlateCSV` folder in your browser. If you don't have a server you can run `sencha web start`
to run a basic local server.

The first time you build the app, it will download the correct version of the framework from Sencha.
